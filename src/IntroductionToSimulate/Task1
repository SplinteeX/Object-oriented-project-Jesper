Everything could be analyzed as simulation, but here is some what comes to my mind: Everyday cycle
(Waking up, Getting up, going to sleep and repeat). Making a cup of coffee (Turning coffeemaker on,
get water, put coffee, wait, turn coffee maker off and repeat). Simulations are good way to try things
before doing them to reduce failures and expenses.
