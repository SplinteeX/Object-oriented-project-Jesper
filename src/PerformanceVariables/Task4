Initialization:
    Create a class Simulator.
    Define initializeSimulation() method to set up simulation variables, model state, and event lists.

Scheduling Initial Events:
    Implement scheduleInitialEvents() to set the starting events for the simulation.

Simulation Loop:
    Create a loop in simulationLoop() that runs until the simulation completion criteria are met.

Within the loop:
    Get the time of the next event using getNextEventTimeFromList().
    Move the simulation clock to this time using advanceSimulationClock(nextEventTime).
    Execute events due at the current simulation time using executeEvents().
    Check if the simulation completion criteria are met using checkCompletionCriteria().

Advancing Simulation Clock:
    Implement advanceSimulationClock(double nextEventTime) to update the simulation clock to the time of the next event.

Executing Events:
    Define executeEvents() to handle and execute scheduled events at the current simulation time.

Simulation Completion:
    Implement simulationFinished() and checkCompletionCriteria() methods to determine if the simulation completion conditions are met.

Main Method:
    In the main() method:
    Instantiate the Simulator class.
    Initialize the simulation using initializeSimulation().
    Schedule initial events using scheduleInitialEvents().
    Run the simulation loop using simulationLoop().
