a) A-phase coding:
The Simulator class and its initializeSimulation() method likely handle the A-phase coding.
This phase involves setting up the foundational elements of the simulation.
It encompasses initializing simulation variables, establishing the model state, and preparing the event lists.
This phase is crucial for laying the groundwork before the actual simulation begins.
Essentially, A-phase coding involves the groundwork and initialization necessary to start the simulation.

b) Coding B-events:
The scheduleInitialEvents() method would likely be responsible for coding B-events.
B-events refer to the scheduling of initial events within the simulation.
These events are typically the starting point or triggers for the simulation.
This phase involves specifying and arranging the initial events that kickstart the simulation process.
They set the initial state and conditions for the simulation to begin its progression.

c) Coding C events:
The simulationLoop(), getNextEventTimeFromList(), advanceSimulationClock(nextEventTime), executeEvents(), and
checkCompletionCriteria() methods are involved in handling C events.
C events encompass the ongoing execution and management of events during the simulation loop.
This phase involves:
Retrieving the next event time from the list.
Advancing the simulation clock to that time.
Executing events scheduled for that time.
Checking if the simulation completion criteria are met.
C events involve the core mechanics of progressing the simulation over time, executing events as scheduled,
and monitoring the criteria for simulation completion.
