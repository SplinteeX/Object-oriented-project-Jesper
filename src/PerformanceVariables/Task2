Directly Observed Variables (Arrived, Serviced, Active Time, Total Time):
These are directly observed or recorded metrics, including the number of arriving patients (A), serviced patients (C),
time spent treating patients (B), and total simulation time (T).

Derived Metrics Category:
These measures are calculated or derived from the directly observed variables.
Service Point Utilization (U), Service Throughput (X),
and Service Time (S) are derived to analyze resource utilization, capacity, and efficiency based on A, C, B, and T.

Directly Observed Additions Category:
Response Time (R) and Waiting Time (W) are directly observed metrics that impact patient experience and satisfaction.

Derived from Response & Waiting Time Category:
Derived measures, such as Response Time (R) and Average Queue Length (N), are calculated from Response Time (R) and
Waiting Time (W), providing insights into system efficiency and patient congestion.
